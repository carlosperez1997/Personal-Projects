# Personal-Projects
Hello,

In this repository I wanted to share some personal projects I have developed to enhance my knowledge and Data Science skills with different projects. 

** Netflix Viewing History EDA
    
The aim of this project is to see how my consumption on Netflix really is and to answer some questions throught the insights the data provides. The project has been developed in Python using the my personal Viewing History in Netflix. Webscraping has been used to get the TV shows and films durations (which do not appear in the file provided by Netflix).

The results were suprising, from 2016 to 2020 I've spent 10% of my time watching Netflix (considering a day has 24 hours, so sleep is considered). However, I decreased my consumption over the years, and I am now more keen on films rather than on TV shows.
