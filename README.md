# *Projects*
Hello, 
My name is Carlos Pérez and I am an aerospace engineer at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya and also a budding Data Scientist enthusiast about Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and the power they provide. 

In this repository I wanted to share some personal projects I have developed to enhance my knowledge and DS, ML and AI skills with different projects. 

## *Netflix Viewing History EDA*
    
The aim of this project is to see how my consumption on Netflix really has been during these years and to answer some questions throught the insights the data provides. The project has been developed in Python using the my personal Viewing History in Netflix. Webscraping has been used to get the TV shows and films durations (which do not appear in the file provided by Netflix).

The results were suprising, from 2016 to 2020 I've spent 10% of my time watching Netflix (considering a day has 24 hours, so sleep is considered). Moreover, I decreased my consumption over the years, and I am now more keen on films rather than on TV shows.
